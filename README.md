Sudokuplotter
=============

Code used to run an automatic sudoku solver.
Created by Jos Feenstra and my self, our suporvisor was Dov Scheinowitz.

Video of the plotter in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O7KezpXGDY

Main code:

* Comb.py: The main program, it combines all the different parts
* Finder.py: OCR for to recognize the sudoku from a photo.
* Algx.py: Algorithm X, used to solve the sudoku. 
* Motor_control.py: Code used to control the motors through Piface.


P.S. Sorry, the code is bit of a mess.
